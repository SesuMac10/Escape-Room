Game Summary - One day, you were wondering through the kingdoms market in search of food, when suddenly you were captured by the king’s soldiers. Confused, you ask why you were captured as you have done nothing wrong. The soldier informs you that, you are a rare species of human with magic blood. Magic blood is used to make strong consumable potions which grants the consumer different types of powers. The king is hunting people with this blood to obtain strong powers and rule the other kingdoms. They send you to the wizard's dungeon to be experimented on. The wizard puts you in his prison cell and prepares the right ingredients and steps needed to make this powerful potion. You have been trapped within the castle’s dungeon for 3 days when suddenly, the wizard lets you out of the prison cell all tied up as he is going to begin the brewing of the potion. The wizard then realizes that he had forgotten some ingredients and goes out to fetch them immediately. You manage to escape out of the ropes he has tied you up in. This gives you time to escape the dungeon before he comes back with the ingredients needed to experiment on you. You look around the dungeon to look for objects that may help you escape.
